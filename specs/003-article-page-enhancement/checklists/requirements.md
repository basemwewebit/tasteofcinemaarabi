# Specification Quality Checklist: Article Page Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The three user stories are independently deployable slices: P1 (thumbnail), P2 (design), P3 (scraping integrity).
- SC-004 references "Lighthouse mobile usability score" as a measurement benchmark — retained as an acceptable verification standard, not an implementation technology.
- FR-006 references specific typography minimums (line-height 1.7, 1.1rem) — these are design constraints appropriate to a visual design specification, not technology choices.
